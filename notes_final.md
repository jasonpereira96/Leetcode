# Tree

An inorder traversal of a BST gives its nodes in sorted order.

# Graph Theory

A graph, G, is a tree iff the following two conditions are met:

- G is fully connected. In other words, for every pair of nodes in G, there is a path between them.
- G contains no cycles. In other words, there is exactly one path between each pair of nodes in G.
